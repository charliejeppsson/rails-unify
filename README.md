<h1>Unify - Don't miss out on valuable connections</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The idea of Unify is to be the "Happn" for the professional network. That is, helping professionals network more effectively with a location-based event platform.</p>

<p>First, the web app allows organizations to create digital pages for events with networking potential. Second, it enables other users to attend, check in (only during the actual event and if within a radius of one kilometer from the event location), see other attendants along with information collected from their LinkedIn account, and connect and chat with others who are checked in. Thus enabling them to network more effectively.</p>

<p>Unify was built by four students over the last two weeks of batch #75 of <strong><a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon's web development bootcamp</a></strong> in Barcelona.</p>
